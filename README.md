# üëã About Me

I‚Äôm currently working on:  
Advancing my programming and analytical capabilities through academic and personal projects focused on data-driven web applications. I actively develop using **Streamlit** to rapidly prototype interactive data apps and am expanding into **full-stack Python development with Reflex**, targeting the creation of smarter, scalable, and high-impact solutions. Every project is an opportunity to challenge assumptions, rethink processes, and engineer tools that deliver measurable results.

I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on:  
High-impact data science, machine learning, and AI-driven web development projects where strategic thinking, efficient execution, and real-world impact are mandatory. I aim to contribute to initiatives that don‚Äôt just optimize ‚Äî but disrupt and redefine industries through data-driven innovation.

I‚Äôm looking for help with:  
Deepening my expertise in advanced machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, NLP models), scalable AI architectures, and practical full-stack Python integrations. I‚Äôm also seeking mentorship to strategically prepare for graduate studies abroad in programs that prioritize applied research and global technological impact.

I‚Äôm currently learning:  
Python, SQL, statistical modeling, machine learning, full-stack development with **Streamlit** and **Reflex**, with a clear focus on predictive analytics, dynamic web solutions, and business intelligence systems.

Ask me about:  
How I synchronize full-time work, university studies, and continuous technical development while executing data science projects such as **vehicle price prediction models**, **customer segmentation clustering**, **metal purity classification systems**, and **sentiment analysis with NLP** ‚Äî all while keeping a long-term vision alive.

Fun fact:  
I‚Äôm a music enthusiast who believes creativity isn't a luxury ‚Äî it's a critical engineering tool for crafting elegant, disruptive, and high-performance solutions.

# ‚úä Manifesto

I believe technology is not about tools ‚Äî it's about transforming complexity into opportunity.  
I question first, then build.  
I learn aggressively, but always with a strategic endgame.  
I reject comfort zones, bureaucratic inertia, and "this is how we've always done it" thinking.  
I don't just solve problems. I redesign them from first principles.  
If it doesn't create real impact, it's noise.  
I‚Äôm here to engineer what‚Äôs next.
